Album Sound Check
=================

Resets the iTune's soundcheck tags to be the correct value across the album, not per-song.

Uses the Python/Objective-C bridge.

GPLv2.

More details on behavior and use can be found in [this blog post][http://scottr.org/blog/2009/apr/22/album-sound-check-gui/] I wrote about the issue and solution.
